## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Fine-Tuning LLMs Under Single-GPU Constraints (MSc Thesis)
- Benchmarked Full Fine-Tuning vs PEFT methods (LoRA, BitFit, Prefix, Prompt, IA³, Adapters) on BERT-base  
- Evaluated accuracy, F1, VRAM usage, and training time on IMDb and AG News  
- Found that Prompt Tuning, LoRA, and Adapters achieved near full-tuning results with up to 56% less VRAM  
- Tools: Hugging Face, PyTorch, PEFT, JupyterHub

### 🔹 Forex Time Series Forecasting (BSc Final Project)
- Built an LSTM model to predict EUR/USD price trends using MACD, RSI, and Fibonacci features  
- Achieved R² = 0.89 and low MSE across multiple timeframes  
- Tools: PyTorch, yfinance, pandas, matplotlib

### 🔹 Sentiment Classification with BERT
- Fine-tuned `bert-base-uncased` on IMDb using LoRA and BitFit  
- Compared metrics across learning rates and batch sizes to optimize accuracy  
- Tools: Hugging Face, PyTorch, Google Colab

### 🔹 CNN Evaluation – MNIST & CIFAR-10
- Trained and evaluated VGG16, ResNet18, and GoogleNet architectures  
- Compared accuracy, convergence, and parameter efficiency  
- Tools: PyTorch, scikit-learn, matplotlib

### 🔹 Copy-When-Uncertain Simulation
- Modeled reinforcement-learning agents that learn via exploration or imitation under variable uncertainty  
- Visualized performance differences between strategies  
- Tools: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
